/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"
```

Test your configuration with Homebrew (you can safely ignore the warnings about X11 missing)

```
brew doctor

brew install redis
```

Enter these 3 lines to automatically start Redis

mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp /usr/local/Cellar/redis/2.2.12/io.redis.redis-server.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.redis.redis-server.plist
